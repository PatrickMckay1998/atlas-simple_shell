    I want to group different prototype functions together  in seperate files

    -We will need to make sure we have a good understanding of pointer functions and how they work 

    -Do we need to use execve() and then put in whatever command the user inputs?  
    
    -does the argument inside execve() need to be a pointer function?
}
