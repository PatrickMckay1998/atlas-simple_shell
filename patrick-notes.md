So far I have a program that asks for user input, takes that input and prints it out. 

Now we need to add an infinite loop - DONE

The program also needs to take in more than one arguement, it only takes one word and no more - WRITTEN/NEEDS DEBUG
- My program takes multiple inputs but it goes through the loop every time, prints out 'enter command' and then displays the input until all the words are displayed
- I am not sure how to get it to display the full string on just one line, I was thinking of adding a counter inside of the second while loop


I really think taking the execve command and putting it into its own prototype file will help 


int main(void)
{
    char command[] - /usr/bin/ls;
    -I wonder if we can use our input that we get from the user and put that here instead, or even the token. 

    char * argvec[] = {"ls", NULL}
    char* envVEC = {NULL}


}
